# Algorithm 1: The Island problem

## Description
The Island problem is a Python script that determines the size of the largest land mass that can be formed by changing a single
water cell (represented by 1) to a land cell (represented by 0) in a given matrix.

## Example Input
matrix = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]

# Algorithm 2: Unique Starting City

## Description
The Unique Starting City is a Python script that calculates the starting city for a circular tour based on provided city distances, fuel levels, and miles per gallon (mpg). It helps you determine if completing a circular tour with the available fuel is possible and returns the index of the starting city from which the circular tour is possible.

## Example Input
```python
city_distances = [5, 25, 15, 10, 15]
fuel = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]
mpg = 10

# Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new Python file.

3. Copy and paste the code from `Unique_starting_city.py` into your Python file OR Download the python file.

4. Modify the values of `city_distances`, `fuel`, and `mpg` in the code to match your specific input. You can replace the sample values with your own data.

5. Save the Python file with an appropriate name, such as `Unique_starting_city.py`.

6. Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter or command prompt.

7. The script will calculate and display the starting city for a circular tour based on the provided input.
