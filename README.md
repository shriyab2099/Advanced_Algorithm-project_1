# Advanced_Algorithm-project_1

# Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new Python file.

3. Download the python files `algorithm1.py` and `algorithm2.py`

6. Save the Python file with an appropriate name, such as `algorithm1.py` and `algorithm2.py`.
   
8. You can replace the Example Input values with your own data.

9. Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter or command prompt.

To Run the program using the command on terminal: 
python algorithm1.py
python algorithm2.py

if this didnt work use 
python3 algorithm1.py
python3 algorithm2.py


# Algorithm 1: The Island problem

## Description
The Island problem is a Python script that determines the size of the largest land mass that can be formed by changing a single
water cell (represented by 1) to a land cell (represented by 0) in a given matrix.

## Example Input
```python
matrix = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]

# Algorithm 2: Unique Starting City

## Description
The Unique Starting City is a Python script that calculates the starting city for a circular tour based on provided city distances, fuel levels, and miles per gallon (mpg). It helps you determine if completing a circular tour with the available fuel is possible and returns the index of the starting city from which the circular tour is possible.

## Example Input
```python
city_distances = [5, 25, 15, 10, 15]
fuel = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]
mpg = 10
